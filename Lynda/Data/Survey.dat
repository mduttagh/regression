There are to many one off situations that the system cannot handle.  The system is not user friendly or intuitive.  The data out of the system is inaccurate, which may be user error, but the system is just very hard to use.  The system does not have built in features to not allow errors to occur, not simply notify people of errors; i.e., chartfield validation.  It is a shame to say, the community would rather go back to a 30 year old legacy system than an up-to-date, technoligically advanced system, simply because the product does not meet the user community needs.

I have stopped being able to use JEMS in Internet Explorer as you cannot type into the form.  When I'm reviewing JEMS2 entries it says that I'm the submitter even though I am the approver. Entries are STILL disappearing (staff submits but they do not get to my approval queue) so my staff needs to re-submit them. When staff tries to re-submit they get an error message telling them their entry is a duplicate.  Very often a journal comes through without an attachment, even though an attachment was uploaded as support when it was submitted. Have stopped notifying ITS each time it happens since it is clear ITS cannot find a reason for the problem or stop it from happening, and we already have a workaround which is just to re-submit the entry. Uploading a large file to JEMS takes too long.	Dissatisfied	Dissatisfied	Neutral	Neutral	Neutral	Sometimes fame does not load, and there is no known reason or it. No notification alerts to the users to anticipate an outage, no warning, just when I click it I am directed to a page with a bunch of techy language words on a screen, and it is not fame.

After I am logged off due to inactivity and I want to get back in and am prompted to re-enter my username and password, doing so does not bring back the real application.. You are inside UDW+ but the real menu is not there and you can't do anything so you have to close out of the application completely and re-open it. I think logging back in has worked for me before but only if it's a very short period of time that I was inactive for.	 	 	 	 	 	 	Very Dissatisfied	The department needs to be purged. There is an arrogance in some who work in ITS and a lack of wanting to take responsibility when something goes wrong.

As a non technical person managing a system, I have always felt that he has provided guidance in a respectful and supportive manner.  I also feel that has he is good at getting us assistance from some resistant and unfriendly IT teams that exist outside of his own.  Honestly, without his support, we would be unable to provide the service level we provide to the University. 

Though Prinson and most members have been supportive, there have been occasions when I have worked with some where I have felt uncomfortable with their communication as it felt a bit judgmental and they seemed less open (or able) to explain things in a non technical way.  Fortunately, this has been less frequent and I have generally reached out to Prinson to ensure that I have had a positive experience.  

Though I know the team attempts to be as responsive as possible, and are always available during emergency situations,  the intense workload of the team has sometimes required that reach out multiple times when gathering information on issues the team views as less critical. Though I recognize that this occasional service gap may point to a need for greater resources for a team that provides the day to day support for so many critical systems, as a client I sometimes found it hard to not have the information I needed.  Again though I think this points to a need for additional resources and some new processes and not any performance needs for individuals.	1	0	0	2.241	0	 	 	-1	1	 	 	68	 	 	 	 	 	80	60	80	60	60	68	Neutral	80	Selected	1.4210854715202E-014	2.57318066708531E-015

TOS is doing excellent work, almost always with a smile.
Follow a consistent maintenance schedule; leverage costly infrastructure to avoid requiring system outages for routine maintenance; implement cross-organizational change management to minimize system breakdowns; audit means of user access to applications (like Workflow, ModTrak, etc.) to confirm consistent, intuitive user experiences.
There are other applications for which TOS runs the infrastructure, but which have no "app lead," and so therefore are either at risk or underperforming; audit these apps to evaluate which ones should have "app leads," which could mitigate enterprise risks and improve the profile of TOS.	1	0	0	1.169	0	 	 	-1	3	80	 	84	84	 	 	 	 	73.3333333333333	73.3333333333333	80	86.6666666666667	100	82.6666666666667	Very Satisfied	80	Selected	3.5527136788005E-015	8.25989152586852E-016

It is infuriating to get a canned response that says "Your request regarding Service Desk (NYU ITS) with reference number #XXXXXX has been resolved with Resolution Reason: Fixed" when the problem has not been fixed.  This includes messages from all offices using Service Link (registrar, financial aid, etc.) not just ITS.  Also Service Link auto responses do not include the initial email to the University so the client has no conversation thread when problems continue.	1	0	0	.795	0	 	 	-1	2	 	 	 	 	60	 	60	 	60	60	60	60	60	60	Neutral	80	Selected	1.4210854715202E-014	2.57318066708531E-015

Its performance and up-time do not seem to be superior.  Its inflexibility and proven inability to replace less structured environments (which persist in all information domains on other competing DW's) do not seem to support the arguments for it over other technical solutions to data warehousing needs. 

I fear it may soon be time to look at what will replace OBIEE as Oracle pulls away from it, and all the light and fury around loyalty to our current implementation of it (and the business logic coded into it that can not be easily extracted again for use elsewhere) will continue to take precedence over the practical information needs of our various offices.

I think the team tasked with development/consolidation of the UDW's should be less driven by their sponsors to promise the moon years before they can make good on those promises, and should be allowed to focus on concrete improvements in reliability and availability of base data only, not on its analysis, nor on metrics that do no have widespread consensus, nor hosting within their reporting software a library of "official reports."  Official data sets, yes, but not official reports, and especially not official reports on dynamic updating transactional data.

We run a very complex organization and yet staff/faculty information are not always enetred into the system correctly which in turn creates errors on payroll processing - sometimes beacues the wrong attribute was entered that changes everything on an employee - by accident.   I know we are still learning and things are getting better, but there are so many of these little issues that we spend more time on tracking and fixing.  it makes people/central admin look inept when delays or errors in payroll continue to occur to faculty and  others.

Second - we ocntinue to have challenges in which data in UDW+ is not correct, sometimes becuase fame isn't correct - sometiems relating to an incorrect inetrface between fame and UDW+ - and usually relating to foreign currencies, or the cmomplex structures in place for the global sites which create question on the integretity of the data/reporting.
