As a non technical person managing a system, I have always felt that he has provided guidance in a respectful and supportive manner.  I also feel that has he is good at getting us assistance from some resistant and unfriendly IT teams that exist outside of his own.  Honestly, without his support, we would be unable to provide the service level we provide to the University.   Though Prinson and most members have been supportive, there have been occasions when I have worked with some where I have felt uncomfortable with their communication as it felt a bit judgmental and they seemed less open (or able) to explain things in a non technical way.  Fortunately, this has been less frequent and I have generally reached out to Prinson to ensure that I have had a positive experience.    Though I know the team attempts to be as responsive as possible, and are always available during emergency situations,  the intense workload of the team has sometimes required that reach out multiple times when gathering information on issues the team views as less critical. Though I recognize that this occasional service gap may point to a need for greater resources for a team that provides the day to day support for so many critical systems, as a client I sometimes found it hard to not have the information I needed.  Again though I think this points to a need for additional resources and some new processes and not any performance needs for individuals.",1,0,0,2.24,0,,,-1,1,,,68,,,,,,80,60,80,60,60,68,Neutral,80,Selected,0.00E+00,0.00E+00

There are also very long delays in getting assistance to fix or change workflow paths...even if paths are for ULT members (How can we tell a Dean or an SVP that they have to wait a month or so for a reimbrusement because their new assistant is not added to a path for some technical reason?)",Neutral,Satisfied,Neutral,Neutral,Dissatisfied,"Hyperion PLanning is an excellent tool, support on it, however, is awful.

We run a very complex organization and yet staff/faculty information are not always enetred into the system correctly which in turn creates errors on payroll processing - sometimes beacues the wrong attribute was entered that changes everything on an employee - by accident.   I know we are still learning and things are getting better, but there are so many of these little issues that we spend more time on tracking and fixing.  it makes people/central admin look inept when delays or errors in payroll continue to occur to faculty and  others.",Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,"first - I have a very omplex and confusing security access so any reporting I need to do takes so much time to build - too much time - that I just simply avoid personally using these tools - asking my staff to do the analysis instead.  (NOT GOOD)/. Second - we ocntinue to have challenges in which data in UDW+ is not correct, sometimes becuase fame isn't correct - sometiems relating to an incorrect inetrface between fame and UDW+ - and usually relating to foreign currencies, or the cmomplex structures in place for the global sites which create question on the integretity of the data/reporting.
