QUALIFICATION CODE: (M) 
The sub-field for Qualification Codes may be used to make the property identification unique among  
others with the same block and lot designation.  The qualification code sub-field has eleven spaces.  
The only codes that may be used are listed below: 
 
. W - Ward - followed by a two-digit number from 01 to 99 indicating the ward in which the property is located. 

. S - Sector - followed by a two-digit number from 01 to 99 indicating the sector in which the property is located.

 Note: A unit number may be numeric, alpha or alpha/numeric.  Leading zeros in the unit  number will remain intact on the Master File. 
 
      If unit numbers are repeated in more than one building on the same lot, the number may be    
      constructed as follows: CAO67 C = the condominium indicator, A = the building indicator and  
      067 = the unit number.  In order to insure proper sequencing always use C plus all four positions.  
 
• MXXXX - Indicates a mobile home.  (Substitute the unit number for the X's).
